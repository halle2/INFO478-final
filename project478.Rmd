## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(usdata)

alzheimers_mortality_state <- read.csv("INFO 478/alzheimers.csv")
income_2022 <- read.csv("INFO 478/Median Household Income data - Sheet1.csv")
education_2022 <- read.csv("INFO 478/Bachelor's Attainment by Percentage - Sheet1.csv")

head(alzheimers_mortality_state,5)

alzheimers_mortality_state$STATE <- abbr2state(alzheimers_mortality_state$STATE)

head(income_2022,5)
income_2022 <- income_2022 %>% 
  rename(STATE = Name)

head(education_2022, 5)
education_2022 <- education_2022 %>% 
  rename(STATE = Name)


df <- merge(alzheimers_mortality_state, income_2022, by="STATE")
df <- merge(df, education_2022, by="STATE")
df <- df %>% 
  filter(YEAR == 2022)

df <- df %>% 
  rename(`Median Income` = X2022.x)
df <- df %>% 
  rename(`Bachelor's degree percentage` = X2022.y)

df

```
